    Imdac.github.io > 

    They contact the other compputers to tell them where this website lives. > 

    It gets the IP Address (numbers the represent the address of the server) >

    When we make this request to the router > 

    the DNS Server replies with where this website lives > the web browers 

    goes to the IP Address and says hey I am looking for IMDAC.GITHUB.IO > 

    The server then says ok let me find that for you JEff > 

    It goes through the folder structure and finds the page >
